# Announcing an Amoveo testnet
### October 19, 2017

The launching of this testnet is a major milestone for Amoveo.

* the off-chain markets seem to be working.
* the consensus mechanism is fully optimized for light nodes.

If you try out the testnet, please attempt to use these parts, and report back about what goes wrong:

* syncing blocks
* mining
* creating and deleting accounts
* spending
* making channels
* closing channels in various ways
* The oracle
* channel payments
* channel bets
* channel bets via off-chain market

I want to know about anything that is uncomfortable or confusing.

So far you need to use a text terminal in order to participate with the testnet, there is no gui interface. [Here is our roadmap, so you can see what will be made next](docs/community_roadmap.md)
