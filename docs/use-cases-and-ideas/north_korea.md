How can blockchain protect us from nuclear armageddon?

Blockchains can be used to make us much safer.

Blockchain markets can be used to pay whistle blowers to warn us where a bomb will fall. Probably anyone who invests enough money to buy a nuclear bomb will want to get as much value from it as they can.
They can only fire it once.
So I expect they will consult a team of experts to decide where to launch.
This team will know where the bomb is likely to fall.
They can use the markets to anonymously warn us where the bomb is likely to fall.
They will get financially rewarded for providing accurate information, and financially punished for providing incorrect information.
The whistle blower who warns us about the bombs first will get the biggest reward, so the incentive is to give the victims the most amount of time to prepare for the disaster as possible.

Blockchain markets can be used to estimate the likelyhood of a nuclear disaster in any location.
With these estimates, it becomes possible for people to effectively prepare for a nuclear disaster.
We can measure if it is worth it to invest in a bomb shelter.
We can know whether we would be better off moving somewhere else.

Blockchain markets can be used to give people insurance against nuclear bombs.
So if your land becomes unusable due to a bomb, you can have money to afford to move somewhere different.
Or if you should die in the nuclear blast, these markets can act as life insurance, so that your family will still have the resources they need.

Blockchains can make nuclear bombs into a less effective tool for terrorists.
Once we are able to know the actual odds of a nuclear blast, we wont have to watch the news and be terrified by rumors.
We will have the information we need clearly and concisely, so we can quickly know whether it is a problem worth dealing with, or if it is something you can afford to ignore.
This will remove a lot of the terror associated with nuclear bombs, and make nuclear bombs a less effective weapon for terrorism.
It will restore our peace of mind, so we can stop wasting energy on crazy people.
